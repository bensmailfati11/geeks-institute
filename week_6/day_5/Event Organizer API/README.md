## 🧪 Testing (REST Client)

1. Open `rest/auth.rest` → run **register** & **login** requests.
2. Copy the `token` from login response:

```json
{
  "user": {...},
  "token": "eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIs..."
}
```

3. Paste token at the top of `rest/events.rest`:

```
@org_token = eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIs...
@member_token = ...
@admin_token = ...
```

4. Create an event → copy `_id` → set:

```
@event_id = your_event_id
```

5. Run all other requests (update, delete, register, unregister).

> `.rest` files are ignored by Git to protect your tokens.

## 🧰 Tech Stack

- Node.js (ES Modules)
- Express.js
- MongoDB + Mongoose
- JWT Authentication
- bcryptjs (password hashing)

---

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

**MongoDB not connecting**

```bash
# Windows
net start MongoDB
# macOS / Linux
sudo systemctl start mongod
```

**Invalid token** → copy full token from login response without quotes.
**Event not found** → create event first, copy `_id` into `@event_id`.
**Port 3001 already in use** → change `.env` PORT or kill process.

---

## 🔒 Security

- Never commit `.env` or `.rest` files
- Use a strong `JWT_SECRET` in production
- Tokens expire after 24h — log in again to refresh
